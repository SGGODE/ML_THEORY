Welcome to the Introduction to machine learning lesson!

Thanks to machine learning, exciting changes are happening across all areas of society, including:

Recent advancements in industries such as autonomous vehicles.
Accurate and rapid translation of the text into hundreds of languages.
AI assistants you might find in your home.
Worker safety improvements.
Quicker pharmaceutical design and development.
Machine learning is a complex subject area. Our goal in this lesson is to introduce you to some of the most common terms and ideas used in machine learning. We will then walk you through the different steps involved in machine learning and finish with a series of examples that use machine learning to solve real-world situations.

Let's look at the outline for this lesson.

This lesson is divided into the following sections:

First, we'll discuss what machine learning is, common terminology, and the common components involved in creating a machine learning project.
Next, we'll step into the shoes of a machine learning practitioner. Machine learning involves using trained models to generate predictions and detect patterns from data. To gain a better understanding, we'll break down the different steps involved and examine a common process that applies to the majority of machine learning projects.
Finally, we'll use the steps that we described and take you through three real-life scenarios that might be faced by machine learning practitioners.

Machine learning is a new field created at the intersection of statistics, applied math, and computer science. 
Because of the rapid and recent growth of machine learning, each of these fields might use slightly different formal definitions of the same terms.

Terminology
Machine learning, or ML, is a modern software development technique that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data.

In supervised learning, every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value 
associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to 
maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.

In unsupervised learning, there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn 
the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.
