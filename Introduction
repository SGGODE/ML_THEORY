Welcome to the Introduction to machine learning lesson!

Thanks to machine learning, exciting changes are happening across all areas of society, including:

Recent advancements in industries such as autonomous vehicles.
Accurate and rapid translation of the text into hundreds of languages.
AI assistants you might find in your home.
Worker safety improvements.
Quicker pharmaceutical design and development.
Machine learning is a complex subject area. Our goal in this lesson is to introduce you to some of the most common terms and ideas used in machine learning. We will then walk you through the different steps involved in machine learning and finish with a series of examples that use machine learning to solve real-world situations.

Let's look at the outline for this lesson.

This lesson is divided into the following sections:

First, we'll discuss what machine learning is, common terminology, and the common components involved in creating a machine learning project.
Next, we'll step into the shoes of a machine learning practitioner. Machine learning involves using trained models to generate predictions and detect patterns from data. To gain a better understanding, we'll break down the different steps involved and examine a common process that applies to the majority of machine learning projects.
Finally, we'll use the steps that we described and take you through three real-life scenarios that might be faced by machine learning practitioners.
